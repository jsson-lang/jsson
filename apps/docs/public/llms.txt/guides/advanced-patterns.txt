## Content

JSSON isn't just for simple key-value pairs. Its features can be combined to solve complex configuration challenges. Here are some advanced patterns to supercharge your workflow.

0.1. Clean Configuration with Variables

Avoid repetition and magic numbers by using variables (:=). Variables are scoped and don't appear in the final output.



  
</Tabs>

0.2. 🧪 Test Data Generation

Need to generate thousands of records for load testing? JSSON's ranges and string concatenation make it trivial.

0.2.1. Generating Dates

Combine numeric ranges with string concatenation to generate calendar dates:



  
</Tabs>

0.2.2. Generating User Accounts

Create realistic user profiles by zipping ranges and using templates:



  
</Tabs>

0.3. 🌍 Environment Management

Manage multiple environments (Dev, Staging, Prod) cleanly using the Base + Overlay pattern with include.

0.3.1. 1. Base Configuration (base.jsson)

Define the common settings shared across all environments.

``jsson
// base.jsson
app {
  name = "MyApp"
  version = "1.0.0"
  retry_attempts = 3
}

database {
  driver = "postgres"
  pool_size = 10
}
`

0.3.2. 2. Environment Overlays (prod.jsson)

Include the base config and override only what changes.

`jsson
// prod.jsson
include "base.jsson"

// Override database settings for production
database {
  host = "prod-db.aws.com"
  pool_size = 100  // Higher pool size for prod
}

// Add prod-specific settings
logging {
  level = "error"
  format = "json"
}
`

> Why this works: JSSON's include merges the included file into the current scope. If you redefine a key (like database), JSSON merges the new properties into the existing object, allowing for granular overrides.

0.4. 🏷️ Dynamic Resource Naming

Enforce naming conventions automatically using the map clause. This ensures consistency across your infrastructure configuration.



  
</Tabs>

0.5. 🔢 Matrix Generation

Since v0.0.5, JSSON supports nested map()` transformations, making matrix generation trivial!

0.5.1. Simple Coordinate Grid



  
</Tabs>

0.5.2. Numeric Matrix

Generate a multiplication table or any numeric matrix:



  
</Tabs>

0.5.3. Combinatorial Product Catalog

Create all combinations of product variants:



  
</Tabs>

0.5.4. Advanced: Chess Board

Generate a complete chess board with coordinates:



> Pro Tip: Nested maps unlock infinite possibilities for matrix-like data structures. Combine with ranges for explosive data generation!
