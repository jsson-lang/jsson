Ready to master JSSON? This guide covers all the fundamental syntax you need to know. Let's build your JSSON skills from the ground up! 💪

0.1. Core Concepts

JSSON has just a few simple rules. Master these, and you'll be writing clean configs in no time.

0.1.1. Assignments

The foundation of JSSON: key-value pairs.



  
</Tabs>

> Pro Tip: When in doubt, use quotes! They always work. But skipping them makes your JSSON cleaner.

0.2. Data Types

JSSON supports all JSON data types with a friendlier syntax.

0.2.1. Strings





</Tabs>

0.2.2. Numbers



  
</Tabs>

0.2.3. Booleans



  
</Tabs>

0.3. Objects

Objects in JSSON are beautifully simple — no colons, no commas, just clean nesting.

0.3.1. Simple Objects



  
</Tabs>

0.3.2. Nested Objects



  
</Tabs>

> Use Case: Objects are perfect for configuration files, API responses, and any hierarchical data.

0.4. Arrays

Arrays in JSSON are just like JSON, but cleaner — no quotes needed for simple values!

0.4.1. Simple Arrays



  
</Tabs>

0.4.2. Arrays of Objects



  
</Tabs>

0.4.3. Arrays in Objects

You can use arrays directly as values for object properties:



  
</Tabs>

> Better way: For arrays of objects, use [template arrays](/guides/templates/) — they're much cleaner!

0.5. Comments

Document your configs with comments — they're ignored during transpilation.



  
</Tabs>

0.5.1. Local Variables

Variables declared inside objects are local to that scope:



> Use Case: Variables are perfect for configuration constants, API keys, and any value you use multiple times.

0.6. Building from Simple to Complex

Let's build a real-world example step by step.

0.6.1. Step 1: Basic Info



0.6.2. Step 2: Add Objects



0.6.3. Step 3: Add Arrays



0.6.4. Step 4: Add Nesting



See how natural it feels? No JSON ceremony, just clean configuration!

0.7. Multi-Format Output

Remember, JSSON isn't just for JSON! You can transpile all of this to YAML, TOML, or TypeScript too.

See the [Multi-Format Guide](/guides/multi-format/) for details.

0.8. What's Next?

You've mastered the basics! Here's where to go from here:• [Templates Guide](/guides/templates/) — Learn about template arrays for structured data• [Syntax Reference](/reference/syntax/) — Explore advanced features like ranges, expressions, and map clauses• [CLI Guide](/guides/cli/) — Master the command-line tool
