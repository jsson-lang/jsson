Welcome to JSSON! Let's get you writing cleaner, more readable JSON in just a few minutes. 🚀

0.1. Why JSSON? ✨

JSSON makes writing JSON feel natural. No more wrestling with quotes, commas, and brackets. Write configuration files the way you think about them — clean, readable, and human-friendly.

What makes JSSON special:• No quotes needed for simple values• Variables:• Global scope: Declared at root level, accessible everywhere• Local scope: Declared inside objects, scoped to that object• Shadowing: Inner scopes can override outer variables• Not in output: Variables are internal-only, never appear in final JSON• Template arrays turn spreadsheet-like data into structured JSON• Nested Arrays Map transformations can now be nested inside other maps for multi-level data pipelines• Map transformations for powerful data manipulation• Ranges generate sequences automatically• Includes split large configs into manageable files• Expressions compute values on the fly• Multi-Format Output (JSON, YAML, TOML, TypeScript)

0.2. What You'll Learn

By the end of this guide, you'll:• Install the JSSON CLI• Write your first JSSON file• Transpile it to JSON• Understand the basics of JSSON syntax

0.3. Installation



> Building from source? If you have Go installed, you can build JSSON yourself:
>
> ``bash
> git clone https://github.com/carlosedujs/jsson
> cd jsson
> go build -o jsson cmd/jsson/main.go
> `

0.4. Your First JSSON File

Let's create a simple configuration file. Create a new file called config.jsson:


  
</Tabs>

Rule of thumb: Use quotes when your value has spaces or special characters. Otherwise, skip them!

0.4.1. 2. Objects Are Clean


  
</Tabs>

0.4.2. 3. Arrays Are Simple


  
</Tabs>

0.4.3. 4. Comments Work!

`jsson
// This is a comment
name = João  // Inline comments too!
age = 25
`

Comments are ignored during transpilation — use them to document your configs!

0.4.4. 5. Variables for Reuse

Declare variables with := to avoid repetition. Variables don't appear in the final JSON:


  
</Tabs>

> Pro Tip: Variables are perfect for configuration constants that you use in multiple places!

0.5. Common First-Time Mistakes

0.5.1. ❌ Forgetting Quotes for Multi-Word Values

`jsson
// Wrong
title = Software Engineer

// Right
title = "Software Engineer"
`

0.5.2. ❌ Using Commas Between Fields

`jsson
// Wrong
name = João,
age = 25,

// Right
name = João
age = 25
`

JSSON doesn't need commas! Just put each field on a new line.

0.5.3. ❌ Mixing Syntax Styles

`jsson
// Wrong - mixing object styles
user {
  name = João
  config = { theme: "dark" }  // Don't use JSON syntax inside JSSON
}

// Right
user {
  name = João
  config {
    theme = dark
  }
}
`

0.7. Try It Yourself!

Create a file called practice.jsson and try this:



Then transpile it:

`bash
jsson -i practice.jsson > practice.json
`

Open practice.json` and see the beautiful JSON output!
