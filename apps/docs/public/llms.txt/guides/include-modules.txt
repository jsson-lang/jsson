## Content

As your configurations grow, keeping everything in one file becomes messy. JSSON's include statement lets you split your configs into logical, reusable modules. Let's learn how! 🧩

0.1. Why Use Includes?

Without includes:

``jsson
// One massive 500-line config file 😰
app {
  // 50 lines of app config...
}

database {
  // 100 lines of database config...
}

api {
  // 150 lines of API config...
}

// ... and so on
`

With includes:

`jsson
// main.jsson - Clean and organized! 😎
include "app.jsson"
include "database.jsson"
include "api.jsson"
`

Much better, right?

0.2. Basic Usage

The include statement is simple:



That's it! The contents of the included file are merged into your main file.

0.2.1. Example: Database Config

database.jsson:



main.jsson:



Result (JSON):



0.3. File Paths

JSSON resolves include paths relative to the file containing the include statement.

0.3.1. Relative Paths



0.3.2. Organizing Your Project

Here's a recommended structure for large projects:

`
project/
├── config/
│   ├── main.jsson          # Main entry point
│   ├── app.jsson           # Application settings
│   ├── database.jsson      # Database config
│   ├── api.jsson           # API settings
│   └── environments/
│       ├── dev.jsson       # Development overrides
│       ├── staging.jsson   # Staging overrides
│       └── prod.jsson      # Production overrides
`

main.jsson:



0.4. Real-World Example

Let's build a complete application configuration using modules.

0.4.1. app.jsson



0.4.2. database.jsson



0.4.3. api.jsson



0.4.4. cache.jsson



0.4.5. main.jsson



Now you have a clean, modular configuration that's easy to maintain!

0.5. Multiple Includes

You can include as many files as you need:



Files are processed in order, top to bottom.

0.6. Environment-Specific Configs

Use includes to handle different environments:

0.6.1. base.jsson (shared settings)



0.6.2. dev.jsson



0.6.3. prod.jsson



Then use the appropriate file for each environment!

0.7. Best Practices

0.7.1. 1. Organize by Concern

Group related settings together:

`
config/
├── app.jsson          # Application settings
├── database.jsson     # All database config
├── api.jsson          # API configuration
├── auth.jsson         # Authentication
└── monitoring.jsson   # Monitoring & logging
`

0.7.2. 2. Use Descriptive Names



0.7.3. 3. Keep Includes at the Top



0.7.4. 4. Don't Nest Too Deeply



0.7.5. 5. Document Your Includes



0.8. Common Patterns

0.8.1. Pattern 1: Shared + Environment

`
config/
├── shared.jsson       # Common settings
├── dev.jsson          # Development (includes shared)
├── staging.jsson      # Staging (includes shared)
└── prod.jsson         # Production (includes shared)
`

0.8.2. Pattern 2: Feature Modules

`
config/
├── main.jsson
└── features/
    ├── auth.jsson
    ├── payments.jsson
    ├── notifications.jsson
    └── analytics.jsson
`

0.8.3. Pattern 3: Service-Based

`
config/
├── main.jsson
└── services/
    ├── database.jsson
    ├── cache.jsson
    ├── queue.jsson
    └── storage.jsson
`

0.9. Troubleshooting

0.9.1. File Not Found

`
Error: include file not found: database.jsson
`

Solution: Check that:

1. The file exists
2. The path is correct (relative to the including file)
3. The file extension is .jsson

0.9.2. Circular Dependencies

`
Error: circular include detected
`

Solution: Don't have files include each other:

`
// ❌ Bad
// a.jsson includes b.jsson
// b.jsson includes a.jsson
  }
}} />

0.9.3. main.jsson


Now you have a clean, modular configuration that's easy to maintain!

0.10. Multiple Includes

You can include as many files as you need:



Files are processed in order, top to bottom.

0.11. Environment-Specific Configs

Use includes to handle different environments:

0.11.1. base.jsson (shared settings)


0.11.2. dev.jsson


0.11.3. prod.jsson


Then use the appropriate file for each environment!

0.12. Best Practices

0.12.1. 1. Organize by Concern

``

0.14.2. Circular Dependencies

`

Error: circular include detected

`

Solution: Don't have files include each other:
`

// ❌ Bad
// a.jsson includes b.jsson
// b.jsson includes a.jsson

// ✅ Good
// main.jsson includes both a.jsson and b.jsson

``

0.15. Includes and Multi-Format

Includes work seamlessly with all output formats. The merging happens before transpilation, so you can use includes to organize your config and then output to whatever format you need:

`bash

1. MERGE INCLUDES AND OUTPUT YAML
------------------------------
jsson -i main.jsson -f yaml > config.yaml


2. MERGE INCLUDES AND OUTPUT TYPESCRIPT
------------------------------------
jsson -i main.jsson -f ts > config.ts
```

This makes JSSON a powerful way to manage complex configurations for any tool!
