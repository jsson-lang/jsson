## Content

Scheduling systems need to manage availability across days and time slots. Creating these grids manually is time-consuming and prone to errors.

0.1. The Problem

A medical clinic needs to manage appointments:• 5 weekdays: Monday through Friday• 9 time slots: 9 AM to 5 PM (hourly)• Different pricing: Peak hours cost more

That's 45 time slots to configure. Traditional JSON requires manual entry:

``json
{
  "schedule": [
    {
      "day": "Mon",
      "hour": 9,
      "slot": "Mon-9h",
      "available": true,
      "price": 100
    },
    {
      "day": "Mon",
      "hour": 10,
      "slot": "Mon-10h",
      "available": true,
      "price": 100
    },
    {
      "day": "Mon",
      "hour": 11,
      "slot": "Mon-11h",
      "available": true,
      "price": 100
    }
    // ... 42 more slots 😰
  ]
}
`

Problems:• ❌ Repetitive and boring• ❌ Easy to miss slots• ❌ Hard to update pricing rules• ❌ Difficult to add/remove days

0.2. The JSSON Solution

With nested maps (v0.0.5), generate the entire schedule automatically:

<Code
  lang="javascript"
  code={schedule = (["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri"] map (day) = (
  9..17 map (hour) = {
    day = day
    hour = hour
    slot = day + "-" + hour + "h"
    available = true
    price = hour >= 12 && hour <= 14 ? 150 : 100
  }
))}
/>

That's it! 7 lines generate all 45 time slots with dynamic pricing.

0.3. Output



0.4. Advanced: Full Week with Weekends

Include weekends with different availability and pricing:

<Code
  lang="javascript"
  code={schedule = (["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"] map (day) = (
  9..17 map (hour) = {
    day = day
    hour = hour
    slot = day + "-" + hour + "h"
    
    // Weekends have limited availability
    isWeekend := day == "Sat" || day == "Sun"
    available = isWeekend ? hour >= 10 && hour <= 16 : true
    
    // Dynamic pricing
    isPeakHour := hour >= 12 && hour <= 14
    weekendSurcharge := isWeekend ? 50 : 0
    peakSurcharge := isPeakHour ? 50 : 0
    
    price = 100 + weekendSurcharge + peakSurcharge
  }
))

// Generates 63 slots (7 days × 9 hours)}
/>

0.5. Multi-Room Scheduling

Generate schedules for multiple rooms or providers:



0.6. Appointment Slots with Intervals

Generate 30-minute intervals instead of hourly:



0.7. Blocked Time Slots

Mark certain slots as unavailable:

<Code
  lang="javascript"
  code={schedule = (["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri"] map (day) = (
  9..17 map (hour) = {
    day = day
    hour = hour
    slot = day + "-" + hour + "h"
    
    // Lunch break: 12-13h unavailable
    isLunchBreak := hour == 12
    
    // Wednesday afternoons: staff meeting
    isStaffMeeting := day == "Wed" && hour >= 14
    
    available = !isLunchBreak && !isStaffMeeting
    price = 100
  }
))}
/>

0.8. Key Features Used• Nested Maps — Days × Hours for complete schedule grid• Universal Ranges — 9..17` for time slots• Conditional Logic — Dynamic pricing and availability• Computed Fields — Generate slot IDs, calculate prices

0.9. Real-World Applications

This pattern is perfect for:• Medical Clinics — Doctor appointments and room scheduling• Fitness Studios — Class schedules across days and times• Meeting Rooms — Corporate booking systems• Service Businesses — Barber shops, salons, repair services• Event Venues — Availability grids for bookings• Tutoring Platforms — Teacher availability matrices

0.10. Benefits

95% less code — 7 lines vs 150+ lines of JSON  
Consistent logic — Pricing rules in one place  
Easy updates — Change hours/days instantly  
No gaps — Automatic generation prevents missing slots  
Flexible — Add rooms, days, or intervals easily
