## Content

Generate millions of geographic coordinate records from minimal JSSON code. Perfect for legacy systems, mapping applications, and location-based services.

0.1. The Problem

Imagine you're working with millions of geographic coordinate records in JSON for a legacy system. Writing and maintaining such files manually is:• Impractical — Can't write millions of records by hand• Error-prone — Easy to make mistakes in repetitive data• Hard to maintain — Changes require updating thousands of lines

0.2. The JSSON Solution

With JSSON, you can generate 10,000+ coordinate records from ~20 lines of code!

0.3. Key Features Used

0.3.1. Ranges for Scale



Change one number to scale from thousands to millions!

0.3.2. Map Transformations



Calculate coordinates dynamically based on ID.

0.3.3. Arithmetic Operations



Use division and modulo to create coordinate grids.

0.4. More Examples

0.4.1. GPS Route Waypoints



0.4.2. Geofencing Zones



Notice the arrays in objects (allowedActions) and ternary operators for conditional values!

0.5. Performance

 •  Scale   •  JSSON Lines  •  JSON Records  •  Ratio     • 
 •  ------  •  -----------  •  ------------  •  --------  • 
 •  Small   •  20           •  100           •  5:1       • 
 •  Medium  •  20           •  10,000        •  500:1     • 
 •  Large   •  20           •  1,000,000     •  50,000:1 |

The same 20 lines can generate from hundreds to millions of records!

0.6. When to Use This Pattern

Perfect for:• Mapping applications with grid-based coordinates• Postal code boundary data• GPS tracking systems• Geofencing applications• Location-based services• Legacy systems requiring large JSON files

Not ideal for:• Unique, non-patterned coordinates• Real-time dynamic location data• Small datasets (< 100 records)

0.7. Try It Yourself!

1. Save the city grid example to geo.jsson
2. Run: jsson -i geo.jsson -o geo.json
3. Open geo.json — you'll see 10,000 coordinate records!
4. Want millions? Change 0..9999 to 0..999999
