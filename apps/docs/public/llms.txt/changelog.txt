0.1. v0.0.5 — Nested Logic Power-Up (2025-11-28)

0.1.1. New Features

#### Nested map() Support 🔄

JSSON now allows map() transformations inside other map() transformations.
This enables multi-level pipelines, matrix-like generation, combinatorial data creation, and far more expressive logic.

Example:

``jsson
nested = (0..2 map (g) = (5..6 map (x) = g + x))
`

#### Full Support for Nested Arrays 📦

Nested arrays now work everywhere:• Inside templates• Inside map clauses• As direct literal values• As intermediate evaluated expressions

JSSON automatically expands, flattens, or structures arrays as needed without losing context.

#### Universal Range Expressions 🔢

Ranges (0..N) now work in all places where expressions are allowed:• Inside arrays• Inside map arguments• Inside templates• Nested within other ranges• Used as part of deeper transformations

This makes large-scale data generation extremely simple:

`jsson
0..9999
`

#### Variable Declarations (:=) 📦

Declare variables for reuse and cleaner configuration. Variables are scoped and support shadowing.

`jsson
host := "localhost"
port := 8080
url = host + ":" + port
`

#### Arithmetic Improvements (Division & Modulo) ➗

Arithmetic is now fully stable for / and %.

Modulo (%) and division (/) now work inside map logic, expressions, and nested operations.

Example:

`jsson
hash = "uid-" + (u.id  91 % 17)
`

Invalid operations (like applying modulo directly to an entire range literal) now produce clear semantic errors instead of causing crashes.

0.1.2. Stability & Internal Improvements• Better handling of RangeResult values during deep transformations• More reliable evaluation order for nested arrays and nested maps• Improved safety checks to prevent unexpected binary operations on non-scalar values• Cleaner error messages that explain exactly where an invalid operation was attempted• Internal prep for future collection operators and functional features

0.1.3. Summary

JSSON v0.0.5 turns the language into a true data-generation powerhouse:• Unlimited nesting• Unlimited ranges• Stable math• Cleaner semantics• Smarter expansion rules

Large-scale data creation is now faster, safer, and easier than ever.

0.2. v0.0.4 — Universal Meta-Format (2025-11-26)

0.2.1. New Features

#### Multi-Format Transpilation 🚀

JSSON is no longer just for JSON. You can now transpile your JSSON files into 4 different formats:• JSON (Default)• YAML (-f yaml)• TOML (-f toml)• TypeScript (-f typescript)

#### TypeScript Type Generation

When transpiling to TypeScript, JSSON automatically generates:• as const assertions for immutability• Exported type definitions (export type Config = typeof config)• Fully typed objects ready for use in your frontend or backend

0.2.2. CLI Updates• Added -f / --format flag to specify output format.• Improved error messages for invalid formats.

0.2.3. Website & Playground• New Playground: Now supports tabs for JSON, YAML, TOML, and TypeScript outputs.• Privacy & Terms: Added legal pages to ensure transparency.• Landing Page: Updated to reflect JSSON's new universal capabilities.

0.3. v0.0.3.1 2025-11-25

0.3.1. Bug Fixes• Fixed support negative numbers in expressions.• Added unary minus operator support for negative numbers.

0.4. v0.0.3 — Arrays in Objects & Real-World Examples (2025-11-25)

0.4.1. New Features

#### Arrays as Object Property Values

You can now use arrays directly as object property values!

`jsson
config {
  methods = ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"]
  ports = [8080, 8081, 8082]
  tags = ["api", "v1", "production"]
}
`

This unlocks powerful new use cases:• API gateway configurations with allowed methods• Kubernetes configs with container ports• Feature flags with target user segments• And much more!

#### Arrays in Map Clauses

Map transformations can now include array properties:

`jsson
routes [
  template { service }

  map (r) = {
    service = r.service
    allowMethods = ["GET", "POST", "PUT"]
    allowHeaders = ["Content-Type", "Authorization"]
  }

  "auth"
  "payment"
]
`

0.4.2. Real-World Examples

Added 6 comprehensive real-world examples demonstrating JSSON's power:

1. Geographic Data — Generate millions of coordinate records
2. Kubernetes Configuration — Multi-environment deployments
3. API Gateway — Microservices routing with rate limiting
4. i18n Translations — Multi-language translation management
5. Feature Flags — Environment-specific configuration
6. Database Seeding — Relational data with foreign keys

Each example includes:• Complete JSSON code• JSON output samples• Explanation of techniques used• When to use the pattern

0.4.3. Parser Improvements• Enhanced parseObjectLiteral to support array literals as property values• Better error messages for syntax issues• Improved handling of nested structures

0.4.4. Documentation• New "Real-World Use Cases" section in docs• Overview page explaining production scenarios• Individual pages for each example with detailed explanations• Updated SEO keywords for better discoverability

0.4.5. Bug Fixes• Fixed parsing of complex nested objects with arrays• Improved transpiler handling of mixed data structures

0.4.6. Performance

JSSON v0.0.3 can now handle even more complex scenarios:• ~500 lines of JSSON → 600+ JSON records• Ratios up to 50,000:1 for large-scale data generation
