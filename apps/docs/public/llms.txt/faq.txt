0.1. Getting Started

0.1.1. What is JSSON?

JSSON (JavaScript Simplified Object Notation) is a human-friendly syntax that transpiles to JSON. It removes the ceremony of JSON while maintaining 100% compatibility.

Think of it as: You write JSSON → Transpiler outputs JSON

0.1.2. Why use JSSON instead of JSON?

JSON:

``json
{
  "user": {
    "name": "João",
    "age": 25,
    "admin": true
  }
}
`

JSSON:

`jsson
user {
  name = João
  age = 25
  admin = true
}
`

JSSON is cleaner, more readable, and supports comments!

0.1.3. How do I install JSSON?

Download the binary from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/carlosedujs/jsson/releases) or build from source:

`bash
git clone https://github.com/carlosedujs/jsson
cd jsson
go build -o jsson cmd/jsson/main.go
`

See the [Getting Started guide](/guides/getting-started/) for details.

0.1.4. Is JSSON production-ready?

Yes! JSSON transpiles to standard JSON, so the output is always valid and safe to use in production.

0.2. Syntax Questions

0.2.1. When do I need quotes?

Use quotes when:• Values have spaces: title = "Software Engineer"• Values have special characters: email = "user@example.com"• You want to force a string: version = "1.0.0"

Skip quotes when:• Simple identifiers: name = João• Numbers: age = 25• Booleans: active = true

Rule of thumb: When in doubt, use quotes!

0.2.2. Can I use comments?

Yes! Single-line comments with //:



0.2.3. Do I need commas between fields?

No! JSSON doesn't use commas between object fields:



0.2.4. Can I reuse values?

Yes! Use variables (:=) to define values once and reuse them. Variables are not included in the output JSON.



0.2.5. How do I create nested objects?

Just nest them naturally:



0.2.6. Can I mix JSSON and JSON syntax?

No. Choose one or the other. JSSON files should use JSSON syntax throughout.

0.3. Features

0.3.1. What are template arrays?

Template arrays let you define structure once, then list data rows:



See the [Templates Guide](/guides/templates/) for details!

0.3.2. What is the map clause?

The map clause transforms template data:



It adds computed fields and transforms values!

0.3.3. What are ranges?

Ranges generate numeric sequences using the .. operator.

Since v0.0.5, ranges work everywhere expressions are allowed!



> Pro Tip: Ranges + map transformations = powerful data generation!

0.3.4. Can I nest map transformations?

Yes! Since v0.0.5, you can nest map() inside other map() transformations:



This enables multi-level pipelines and complex data generation!

0.3.5. Can I use nested arrays?

Absolutely! Since v0.0.5, JSSON fully supports nested arrays:



Nested arrays work in templates, maps, objects, and as direct values!

0.3.6. How do includes work?

Use include to split large configs:

database.jsson:



main.jsson:



0.4. Use Cases

0.4.1. What is JSSON good for?• Configuration files (app configs, server settings)• Seed data (database fixtures, test data)• Mock APIs (fake data for development)• Structured lists (products, users, routes)• Data templates (CSV-like data → JSON)• Matrix generation (grids, coordinates, combinatorial data) — New in v0.0.5!

0.4.2. When should I use nested maps?

Use nested maps when you need:• Matrix-like structures — Grids, coordinate systems, 2D/3D data• Combinatorial data — All combinations of product variants (sizes × colors)• Multi-level pipelines — Transform data at multiple nested levels• Large-scale generation — Create thousands of records with patterns



Rule of thumb: Use nested maps for generated patterns, templates for explicit data.

0.4.3. How do I generate large datasets?

JSSON v0.0.5 makes large-scale data generation trivial:



> Performance: JSSON can handle millions of records. The transpiler is fast!

0.4.4. Can I use JSSON for large files?

Yes! Use include to split large configs into modules:

`
config/
├── main.jsson
├── database.jsson
├── api.jsson
└── cache.jsson
`

0.4.5. Can I use JSSON with my build tool?

Yes! Integrate with npm scripts, Makefiles, or CI/CD:

package.json:

`json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build:config": "jsson -i config.jsson -o dist/config.json"
  }
}
`

See the [CLI Guide](/guides/cli/) for integration examples!

0.4.6. Is JSSON faster than JSON?

JSSON adds a transpilation step, so it's slightly slower than parsing JSON directly. However:• Development: JSSON is faster to write and maintain• Production: Use transpiled JSON (no runtime overhead)

0.4.7. Can I validate JSSON files?

Yes! Run the transpiler to check for errors:

`bash
jsson -i config.jsson
`



0.4.8. My template has the wrong number of values

Each row must match the template:



0.4.9. Include file not found

Check that:

1. The file exists
2. The path is correct (relative to the including file)
3. The extension is .jsson

0.4.10. Can't apply operator to range literal

Invalid operations on range literals produce errors:



Rule: Operations on ranges must be done inside map transformations.

0.4.11. Nested maps not working as expected

Make sure you're using parentheses correctly:



Tip: Each map` expression needs its own parentheses when nested!
