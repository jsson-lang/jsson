## v0.0.5 — Nested Logic Power-Up (2025-11-28)

### New Features

#### Nested map() Support 🔄

JSSON now allows `map()` transformations inside other `map()` transformations.
This enables multi-level pipelines, matrix-like generation, combinatorial data creation, and far more expressive logic.

**Example:**

```jsson
nested = (0..2 map (g) = (5..6 map (x) = g + x))
```

#### Full Support for Nested Arrays 📦

Nested arrays now work everywhere:

- Inside templates
- Inside map clauses
- As direct literal values
- As intermediate evaluated expressions

JSSON automatically expands, flattens, or structures arrays as needed without losing context.

#### Universal Range Expressions 🔢

Ranges (`0..N`) now work in all places where expressions are allowed:

- Inside arrays
- Inside map arguments
- Inside templates
- Nested within other ranges
- Used as part of deeper transformations

This makes large-scale data generation extremely simple:

```jsson
0..9999
```

#### Variable Declarations (`:=`) 📦

Declare variables for reuse and cleaner configuration. Variables are scoped and support shadowing.

```jsson
host := "localhost"
port := 8080
url = host + ":" + port
```

#### Arithmetic Improvements (Division & Modulo) ➗

Arithmetic is now fully stable for `/` and `%`.

Modulo (`%`) and division (`/`) now work inside map logic, expressions, and nested operations.

**Example:**

```jsson
hash = "uid-" + (u.id * 91 % 17)
```

Invalid operations (like applying modulo directly to an entire range literal) now produce clear semantic errors instead of causing crashes.

### Stability & Internal Improvements

- Better handling of `RangeResult` values during deep transformations
- More reliable evaluation order for nested arrays and nested maps
- Improved safety checks to prevent unexpected binary operations on non-scalar values
- Cleaner error messages that explain exactly where an invalid operation was attempted
- Internal prep for future collection operators and functional features

### Summary

JSSON v0.0.5 turns the language into a true data-generation powerhouse:

- Unlimited nesting
- Unlimited ranges
- Stable math
- Cleaner semantics
- Smarter expansion rules

Large-scale data creation is now faster, safer, and easier than ever.

## v0.0.4 — Universal Meta-Format (2025-11-26)

### New Features

#### Multi-Format Transpilation 🚀

JSSON is no longer just for JSON. You can now transpile your JSSON files into 4 different formats:

- **JSON** (Default)
- **YAML** (`-f yaml`)
- **TOML** (`-f toml`)
- **TypeScript** (`-f typescript`)

#### TypeScript Type Generation

When transpiling to TypeScript, JSSON automatically generates:

- `as const` assertions for immutability
- Exported type definitions (`export type Config = typeof config`)
- Fully typed objects ready for use in your frontend or backend

### CLI Updates

- Added `-f` / `--format` flag to specify output format.
- Improved error messages for invalid formats.

### Website & Playground

- **New Playground:** Now supports tabs for JSON, YAML, TOML, and TypeScript outputs.
- **Privacy & Terms:** Added legal pages to ensure transparency.
- **Landing Page:** Updated to reflect JSSON's new universal capabilities.

## v0.0.3.1 2025-11-25

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed support negative numbers in expressions.
- Added unary minus operator support for negative numbers.

## v0.0.3 — Arrays in Objects & Real-World Examples (2025-11-25)

### New Features

#### Arrays as Object Property Values

You can now use arrays directly as object property values!

```jsson
config {
  methods = ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"]
  ports = [8080, 8081, 8082]
  tags = ["api", "v1", "production"]
}
```

This unlocks powerful new use cases:

- API gateway configurations with allowed methods
- Kubernetes configs with container ports
- Feature flags with target user segments
- And much more!

#### Arrays in Map Clauses

Map transformations can now include array properties:

```jsson
routes [
  template { service }

  map (r) = {
    service = r.service
    allowMethods = ["GET", "POST", "PUT"]
    allowHeaders = ["Content-Type", "Authorization"]
  }

  "auth"
  "payment"
]
```

### Real-World Examples

Added 6 comprehensive real-world examples demonstrating JSSON's power:

1. **Geographic Data** — Generate millions of coordinate records
2. **Kubernetes Configuration** — Multi-environment deployments
3. **API Gateway** — Microservices routing with rate limiting
4. **i18n Translations** — Multi-language translation management
5. **Feature Flags** — Environment-specific configuration
6. **Database Seeding** — Relational data with foreign keys

Each example includes:

- Complete JSSON code
- JSON output samples
- Explanation of techniques used
- When to use the pattern

### Parser Improvements

- Enhanced `parseObjectLiteral` to support array literals as property values
- Better error messages for syntax issues
- Improved handling of nested structures

### Documentation

- New "Real-World Use Cases" section in docs
- Overview page explaining production scenarios
- Individual pages for each example with detailed explanations
- Updated SEO keywords for better discoverability

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed parsing of complex nested objects with arrays
- Improved transpiler handling of mixed data structures

### Performance

JSSON v0.0.3 can now handle even more complex scenarios:

- ~500 lines of JSSON → 600+ JSON records
- Ratios up to 50,000:1 for large-scale data generation

## v0.0.2 — Arithmetic & Conditional Logic (2025-11-24)

### Features

- **Arithmetic operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- **Comparison operators**: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
- **Ternary operator**: `condition ? true : false`
- **Map transformations** with conditional logic
- **String concatenation** in expressions

### Examples

```jsson
users [
  template { name, age }

  map (u) = {
    name = u.name
    age = u.age
    isAdult = u.age >= 18
    category = u.age >= 18 ? "adult" : "minor"
  }

  "João", 25
  "Maria", 16
]
```

---

## v0.0.1 — Initial Release (2025-11-23)

### Features

- **Core parser** for JSSON syntax
- **Template arrays** for structured data
- **Range expressions** (`1..100`)
- **Include statements** for file composition
- **CLI tool** for transpilation
- **Basic data types**: strings, numbers, booleans, objects, arrays

### Examples

```jsson
users [
  template { name, age }

  "João", 19
  "Maria", 25
]

ports = 8080..8085
```
