import { Code, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

As your configurations grow, keeping everything in one file becomes messy. JSSON's `include` statement lets you split your configs into logical, reusable modules. Let's learn how! 🧩

## Why Use Includes?

**Without includes:**
```jsson
// One massive 500-line config file 😰
app {
  // 50 lines of app config...
}

database {
  // 100 lines of database config...
}

api {
  // 150 lines of API config...
}

// ... and so on
```

**With includes:**
```jsson
// main.jsson - Clean and organized! 😎
include "app.jsson"
include "database.jsson"
include "api.jsson"
```

Much better, right?

## Basic Usage

The `include` statement is simple:

<Code lang="jsson" code={`include "path/to/file.jsson"`} />

That's it! The contents of the included file are merged into your main file.

### Example: Database Config

**database.jsson:**
<Code lang="jsson" code={`database {
  host = "localhost"
  port = 5432
  name = myapp_db
  
  pool {
    min = 2
    max = 10
  }
}`} />

**main.jsson:**
<Code lang="jsson" code={`app {
  name = "My Application"
  version = "1.0.0"
}

include "database.jsson"`} />

**Result (JSON):**
<Code lang="json" code={`{
  "app": {
    "name": "My Application",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  },
  "database": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 5432,
    "name": "myapp_db",
    "pool": {
      "min": 2,
      "max": 10
    }
  }
}`} />

## File Paths

JSSON resolves include paths relative to the file containing the `include` statement.

### Relative Paths

<Code lang="jsson" code={`// Same directory
include "database.jsson"

// Subdirectory
include "config/database.jsson"

// Parent directory
include "../shared/common.jsson"`} />

### Organizing Your Project

Here's a recommended structure for large projects:

```
project/
├── config/
│   ├── main.jsson          # Main entry point
│   ├── app.jsson           # Application settings
│   ├── database.jsson      # Database config
│   ├── api.jsson           # API settings
│   └── environments/
│       ├── dev.jsson       # Development overrides
│       ├── staging.jsson   # Staging overrides
│       └── prod.jsson      # Production overrides
```

**main.jsson:**
<Code lang="jsson" code={`// Core configuration
include "app.jsson"
include "database.jsson"
include "api.jsson"

// Environment-specific (choose one)
include "environments/dev.jsson"`} />

## Real-World Example

Let's build a complete application configuration using modules.

### app.jsson
<Code lang="jsson" code={`app {
  name = "E-Commerce Platform"
  version = "2.1.0"
  debug = false
  
  features {
    newCheckout = true
    recommendations = true
    analytics = true
  }
}`} />

### database.jsson
<Code lang="jsson" code={`database {
  primary {
    host = "db.example.com"
    port = 5432
    name = ecommerce_db
    ssl = true
  }
  
  replica {
    host = "db-replica.example.com"
    port = 5432
    readonly = true
  }
  
  pool {
    min = 5
    max = 20
    timeout = 30000
  }
}`} />

### api.jsson
<Code lang="jsson" code={`api {
  baseUrl = "https://api.example.com"
  version = "v2"
  timeout = 5000
  
  endpoints {
    products = "/products"
    users = "/users"
    orders = "/orders"
    payments = "/payments"
  }
  
  rateLimit {
    requests = 100
    window = 60
  }
}`} />

### cache.jsson
<Code lang="jsson" code={`cache {
  redis {
    host = "cache.example.com"
    port = 6379
    ttl = 3600
  }
  
  strategies {
    products = aggressive
    users = moderate
    orders = minimal
  }
}`} />

### main.jsson
<Code lang="jsson" code={`// Main configuration file
include "app.jsson"
include "database.jsson"
include "api.jsson"
include "cache.jsson"

// Additional settings
monitoring {
  enabled = true
  service = datadog
  apiKey = "your-api-key"
}`} />

Now you have a clean, modular configuration that's easy to maintain!

## Multiple Includes

You can include as many files as you need:

<Code lang="jsson" code={`include "app.jsson"
include "database.jsson"
include "api.jsson"
include "cache.jsson"
include "monitoring.jsson"
include "logging.jsson"`} />

Files are processed in order, top to bottom.

## Environment-Specific Configs

Use includes to handle different environments:

### base.jsson (shared settings)
<Code lang="jsson" code={`app {
  name = "My App"
  version = "1.0.0"
}

features {
  analytics = true
  logging = true
}`} />

### dev.jsson
<Code lang="jsson" code={`include "base.jsson"

app {
  debug = true
}

database {
  host = localhost
  port = 5432
}`} />

### prod.jsson
<Code lang="jsson" code={`include "base.jsson"

app {
  debug = false
}

database {
  host = "prod-db.example.com"
  port = 5432
  ssl = true
}`} />

Then use the appropriate file for each environment!

## Best Practices

### 1. Organize by Concern

Group related settings together:

```
config/
├── app.jsson          # Application settings
├── database.jsson     # All database config
├── api.jsson          # API configuration
├── auth.jsson         # Authentication
└── monitoring.jsson   # Monitoring & logging
```

### 2. Use Descriptive Names

<Code lang="jsson" code={`// Good ✅
include "database-config.jsson"
include "api-endpoints.jsson"

// Bad ❌
include "config1.jsson"
include "stuff.jsson"`} />

### 3. Keep Includes at the Top

<Code lang="jsson" code={`// Good ✅
include "database.jsson"
include "api.jsson"

app {
  name = "My App"
}

// Bad ❌
app {
  name = "My App"
}
include "database.jsson"  // Harder to see what's included`} />

### 4. Don't Nest Too Deeply

<Code lang="jsson" code={`// Avoid this:
// main.jsson includes config.jsson
// config.jsson includes database.jsson
// database.jsson includes pool.jsson
// pool.jsson includes limits.jsson

// Keep it simple - 1-2 levels max`} />

### 5. Document Your Includes

<Code lang="jsson" code={`// Main configuration
// Includes: app, database, API, and cache settings

include "app.jsson"       // Application configuration
include "database.jsson"  // Database connection and pool
include "api.jsson"       // External API settings
include "cache.jsson"     // Redis cache configuration`} />

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Shared + Environment

```
config/
├── shared.jsson       # Common settings
├── dev.jsson          # Development (includes shared)
├── staging.jsson      # Staging (includes shared)
└── prod.jsson         # Production (includes shared)
```

### Pattern 2: Feature Modules

```
config/
├── main.jsson
└── features/
    ├── auth.jsson
    ├── payments.jsson
    ├── notifications.jsson
    └── analytics.jsson
```

### Pattern 3: Service-Based

```
config/
├── main.jsson
└── services/
    ├── database.jsson
    ├── cache.jsson
    ├── queue.jsson
    └── storage.jsson
```

## Troubleshooting

### File Not Found

```
Error: include file not found: database.jsson
```

**Solution:** Check that:
1. The file exists
2. The path is correct (relative to the including file)
3. The file extension is `.jsson`

### Circular Dependencies

```
Error: circular include detected
```

**Solution:** Don't have files include each other:
```
// ❌ Bad
// a.jsson includes b.jsson
// b.jsson includes a.jsson

// ✅ Good
// main.jsson includes both a.jsson and b.jsson
```
