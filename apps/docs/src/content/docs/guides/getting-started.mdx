Welcome to JSSON! Let's get you writing cleaner, more readable JSON in just a few minutes. 🚀

## Why JSSON? ✨

JSSON makes writing JSON feel natural. No more wrestling with quotes, commas, and brackets. Write configuration files the way you think about them — clean, readable, and human-friendly.

**What makes JSSON special:**
- **No quotes needed** for simple values
- **Template arrays** turn spreadsheet-like data into structured JSON
- **Map transformations** for powerful data manipulation
- **Ranges** generate sequences automatically
- **Includes** split large configs into manageable files
- **Expressions** compute values on the fly

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this guide, you'll:
- Install the JSSON CLI
- Write your first JSSON file
- Transpile it to JSON
- Understand the basics of JSSON syntax

## Installation

<Steps>

1. **Download the JSSON binary**

   Head to the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/carlosedujs/jsson/releases) and download the latest version for your platform.

2. **Make it executable** (Linux/macOS)

   ```bash
   chmod +x jsson
   ```

3. **Move to your PATH** (optional but recommended)

   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS
   sudo mv jsson /usr/local/bin/

   # Windows: Add the directory to your PATH environment variable
   ```

4. **Verify installation**

   ```bash
   jsson --version
   ```

</Steps>

> **Building from source?** If you have Go installed, you can build JSSON yourself:
> ```bash
> git clone https://github.com/carlosedujs/jsson
> cd jsson
> go build -o jsson cmd/jsson/main.go
> ```

## Your First JSSON File

Let's create a simple configuration file. Create a new file called `config.jsson`:

<Code lang="jsson" code={`// My first JSSON file
app {
  name = "My Awesome App"
  version = "1.0.0"
  debug = true
}

server {
  host = localhost
  port = 8080
}`} />

Notice how clean this is? No quotes around keys, no commas, no fuss!

## Transpile to JSON

Now let's convert this to JSON:

```bash
jsson -i config.jsson -o config.json
```

This creates `config.json` with perfect, valid JSON:

<Code lang="json" code={`{
  "app": {
    "name": "My Awesome App",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "debug": true
  },
  "server": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 8080
  }
}`} />

**That's it!** You just wrote and transpiled your first JSSON file. 🎉

## Understanding the Basics

Let's break down what makes JSSON special:

### 1. No Quotes Needed (Usually)

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="JSSON">
    <Code lang="jsson" code={`name = João
city = "São Paulo"  // Use quotes for spaces
age = 25`} />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="JSON">
    <Code lang="json" code={`{
  "name": "João",
  "city": "São Paulo",
  "age": 25
}`} />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

**Rule of thumb:** Use quotes when your value has spaces or special characters. Otherwise, skip them!

### 2. Objects Are Clean

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="JSSON">
    <Code lang="jsson" code={`user {
  name = João
  email = joao@example.com
}`} />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="JSON">
    <Code lang="json" code={`{
  "user": {
    "name": "João",
    "email": "joao@example.com"
  }
}`} />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 3. Arrays Are Simple

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="JSSON">
    <Code lang="jsson" code={`colors = [ red, blue, green ]
numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
mixed = [ João, 25, true ]`} />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="JSON">
    <Code lang="json" code={`{
  "colors": ["red", "blue", "green"],
  "numbers": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
  "mixed": ["João", 25, true]
}`} />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 4. Comments Work!

```jsson
// This is a comment
name = João  // Inline comments too!
age = 25
```

Comments are ignored during transpilation — use them to document your configs!

## Common First-Time Mistakes

### ❌ Forgetting Quotes for Multi-Word Values

```jsson
// Wrong
title = Software Engineer

// Right
title = "Software Engineer"
```

### ❌ Using Commas Between Fields

```jsson
// Wrong
name = João,
age = 25,

// Right
name = João
age = 25
```

JSSON doesn't need commas! Just put each field on a new line.

### ❌ Mixing Syntax Styles

```jsson
// Wrong - mixing object styles
user {
  name = João
  config = { theme: "dark" }  // Don't use JSON syntax inside JSSON
}

// Right
user {
  name = João
  config {
    theme = dark
  }
}
```

## Quick Reference

| Feature | JSSON | JSON |
|---------|-------|------|
| **Keys** | `name = value` | `"name": value` |
| **Strings** | `João` or `"João"` | `"João"` |
| **Objects** | `obj { ... }` | `"obj": { ... }` |
| **Arrays** | `[ a, b, c ]` | `["a", "b", "c"]` |
| **Comments** | `// comment` | ❌ Not supported |

## Try It Yourself!

Create a file called `practice.jsson` and try this:

<Code lang="jsson" code={`// Your personal info
person {
  name = "Your Name"
  age = 25
  hobbies = [ coding, reading, gaming ]
  
  address {
    city = "Your City"
    country = Brazil
  }
}

// Your favorite numbers
luckyNumbers = [ 7, 13, 42 ]`} />

Then transpile it:

```bash
jsson -i practice.jsson -o practice.json
```

Open `practice.json` and see the beautiful JSON output!
