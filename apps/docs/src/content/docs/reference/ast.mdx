description: Overview of the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) structure used in JSSON.

Common nodes:

- `Program` — root node containing statements
- `AssignmentStatement` — `name = value` or `name { ... }`
- `IncludeStatement` — `include "path"`
- `ObjectLiteral` — object with keys and nested expressions
- `ArrayLiteral` / `ArrayTemplate` — arrays and template-based rows
- `BinaryExpression`, `MemberExpression`, `RangeExpression` — expressions used in transforms

If you're building tooling that consumes JSSON, inspect `internal/ast` for Go structs and field names.
