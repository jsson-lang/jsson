## v0.0.3 — Arrays in Objects & Real-World Examples (2025-11-25)

### New Features

#### Arrays as Object Property Values

You can now use arrays directly as object property values!

```jsson
config {
  methods = ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"]
  ports = [8080, 8081, 8082]
  tags = ["api", "v1", "production"]
}
```

This unlocks powerful new use cases:

- API gateway configurations with allowed methods
- Kubernetes configs with container ports
- Feature flags with target user segments
- And much more!

#### Arrays in Map Clauses

Map transformations can now include array properties:

```jsson
routes [
  template { service }

  map (r) = {
    service = r.service
    allowMethods = ["GET", "POST", "PUT"]
    allowHeaders = ["Content-Type", "Authorization"]
  }

  "auth"
  "payment"
]
```

### Real-World Examples

Added 6 comprehensive real-world examples demonstrating JSSON's power:

1. **Geographic Data** — Generate millions of coordinate records
2. **Kubernetes Configuration** — Multi-environment deployments
3. **API Gateway** — Microservices routing with rate limiting
4. **i18n Translations** — Multi-language translation management
5. **Feature Flags** — Environment-specific configuration
6. **Database Seeding** — Relational data with foreign keys

Each example includes:

- Complete JSSON code
- JSON output samples
- Explanation of techniques used
- When to use the pattern

### Parser Improvements

- Enhanced `parseObjectLiteral` to support array literals as property values
- Better error messages for syntax issues
- Improved handling of nested structures

### Documentation

- New "Real-World Use Cases" section in docs
- Overview page explaining production scenarios
- Individual pages for each example with detailed explanations
- Updated SEO keywords for better discoverability

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed parsing of complex nested objects with arrays
- Improved transpiler handling of mixed data structures

### Performance

JSSON v0.0.3 can now handle even more complex scenarios:

- ~500 lines of JSSON → 600+ JSON records
- Ratios up to 50,000:1 for large-scale data generation

## v0.0.2 — Arithmetic & Conditional Logic (2025-11-24)

### Features

- **Arithmetic operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- **Comparison operators**: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
- **Ternary operator**: `condition ? true : false`
- **Map transformations** with conditional logic
- **String concatenation** in expressions

### Examples

```jsson
users [
  template { name, age }

  map (u) = {
    name = u.name
    age = u.age
    isAdult = u.age >= 18
    category = u.age >= 18 ? "adult" : "minor"
  }

  "João", 25
  "Maria", 16
]
```

## v0.0.1 — Initial Release (2025-11-23)

### Features

- **Template arrays** for structured data
- **Range expressions** (`1..100`)
- **Include statements** for file composition
- **CLI tool** for transpilation
- **Basic data types**: strings, numbers, booleans, objects, arrays

### Examples

```jsson
users [
  template { name, age }

  "João", 19
  "Maria", 25
]

ports = 8080..8085
```
