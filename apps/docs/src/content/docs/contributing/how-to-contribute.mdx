title: How to Contribute
description: Guidelines for contributing to the JSSON project.
---

- Run existing tests before opening a PR. Tests live under `internal/` and use Go's test tooling.
- Follow existing code style in Go files.
- Add small, focused PRs — it's easier to review.

## Running tests

```powershell
go test ./... 
```

## Local docs

To preview the docs locally, run the dev server in `apps/docs` (see project README or `apps/docs/package.json`).

We love small, well-documented contributions — add examples to `examples/` if you add syntax.
