## Why JSSON?

JSSON (**JavaScript Simplified Object Notation**) is a modern, lightweight
syntax that makes writing JSON faster, cleaner, and way more readable —  
without replacing JSON, and without adding a runtime.

It’s **just a transpiler**.  
You write JSSON → it outputs real JSON.

Perfect for:
- API configs  
- Seed files  
- Mock data  
- Structured lists  
- Data templates  
- Anything that would normally be a giant JSON wall  

## What makes it different?

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Template Arrays" icon="sparkles">
    Generate structured objects using row-based syntax — perfect for lists,
    tables, seed data and mock files.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Map Transformations" icon="bolt">
    Apply transformations inside the syntax using JSSON’s `map (item)` blocks.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Includes & Modularization" icon="folder">
    Split large files with `include "./file.jsson"` and avoid repetition.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Ranges & Steps" icon="list">
    Write lists like `[ 0..10 step 2 ]` — cleaner and faster than ever.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Zero Runtime" icon="code">
    JSSON only transpiles. No hidden logic, no magic, no interpreter needed.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Fun Error Messages" icon="wand">
    Wizards, gremlins and goblins guide you when something breaks.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
