## Why JSSON?

JSSON (**JavaScript Simplified Object Notation**) is a modern, lightweight
meta-format that makes writing configuration faster, cleaner, and way more readable.

It’s **not just for JSON anymore**.  
You write JSSON → it outputs **JSON, YAML, TOML, or TypeScript**.

Perfect for:

- API configs (JSON/YAML)
- Infrastructure as Code (YAML)
- Application Configs (TOML)
- Frontend Constants (TypeScript)
- Seed files & Mock data

## What makes it different?

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Multi-Format Output" icon="rocket">
    Write once, deploy everywhere. Transpile to JSON, YAML, TOML, or fully typed TypeScript.
  </Card>

{" "}
<Card title="Template Arrays" icon="sparkles">
  Generate structured objects using row-based syntax — perfect for lists,
  tables, seed data and mock files.
</Card>

{" "}
<Card title="Map Transformations" icon="bolt">
  Apply transformations inside the syntax using JSSON’s `map (item)` blocks.
</Card>

{" "}
<Card title="Nested Maps" icon="sparkles">
  Maps can be nested inside other maps.
</Card>

{" "}
<Card title="Variables" icon="sparkles">
  Variables can be used to store values that are used multiple times.
</Card>

{" "}
<Card title="Includes & Modularization" icon="folder">
  Split large files with `include "./file.jsson"` and avoid repetition.
</Card>

{" "}
<Card title="Ranges & Steps" icon="list">
  Write lists like `[ 0..10 step 2 ]` — cleaner and faster than ever.
</Card>

{" "}
<Card title="Zero Runtime" icon="code">
  JSSON only transpiles. No hidden logic, no magic, no interpreter needed.
</Card>

{" "}
<Card title="Fun Error Messages" icon="wand">
  Wizards, gremlins and goblins guide you when something breaks.
